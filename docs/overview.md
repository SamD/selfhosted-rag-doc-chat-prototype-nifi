# Architecture Overview

This document covers the complete system architecture, data flow, and component map for the Self-Hosted RAG Ingestion & Chat system.

---

## System Philosophy

The system is built for **air-gapped, high-fidelity document ingestion** on commodity hardware (minipcs, eGPU docks). Every compute-heavy service — LLM, embeddings, WhisperX, OCR — runs as a standalone remote API endpoint on a dedicated host over the LAN. The ingestion worker stack connects to these services over HTTP. A **Database-Driven State Machine** tracks files through a multi-stage pipeline, prioritizing data integrity and traceability over raw speed.

### Core Mandates

- **Physical Isolation**: Files move between directories (`staging/` → `preprocessing/` → `ingestion/` → `consuming/` → `success/`) to ensure the physical state matches the database state at every step.
- **Dual-LLM Isolation**: The system separates the "Normalizer" from the "Chatter":
  - **Supervisor LLM** (`SUPERVISOR_LLM_ENDPOINTS`): Structural transcription and high-density retyping of raw text into clean Markdown.
  - **RAG LLM** (`LLM_PATH`): Conversational reasoning and grounded retrieval with strict citation enforcement.
- **Atomic Handoffs**: Every stage transition is a "Move-then-Update" transaction in DuckDB, ensuring no document is lost or double-processed.
- **Load Balancing**: When multiple backends are available for any service (LLM, embeddings, WhisperX, OCR), HAProxy distributes requests across them with health checks, failover, and round-robin balancing.

## Physical Directory Moves

Files move through directories on disk as they progress through the pipeline. Directory moves and DuckDB state transitions are decoupled — some state changes occur without a directory move, and some directory moves happen without a state change.

| From Dir | To Dir | Worker | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `staging/` | `preprocessing/` | Gatekeeper | Gatekeeper claims the file for extraction |
| `preprocessing/` | `ingestion/` | Gatekeeper | Normalized files handed off for ingestion |
| `ingestion/` | `consuming/` | Producer | Producer claims, moves files to isolation |
| `consuming/` | `success/` | Consumer | Files moved to permanent success archive |
| (any) | `failed/` | Any worker | Error occurred; files moved for debugging |

Files are placed into `staging/` by the user as a pre-pipeline action (not a worker transition).

## DuckDB State Machine Transitions

These are the state transitions tracked in the `ingestion_lifecycle` table. Compare with the directory moves above — some states are reached purely via database update with no file relocation.

| State Transition | Worker | Directory Move | Description |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `NEW → PREPROCESSING` | Gatekeeper | `staging/ → preprocessing/` | Gatekeeper claims the file for extraction |
| `PREPROCESSING → PREPROCESSING_COMPLETE` | Gatekeeper | `preprocessing/ → ingestion/` | Normalization finished; `.md` file and original moved to ingestion |
| `PREPROCESSING_COMPLETE → INGESTING` | Producer | `ingestion/ → consuming/` | Producer claims, moves files to isolation |
| `INGESTING → CONSUMING` | Producer | None | Chunks enqueued; files remain in `consuming/` |
| `CONSUMING → INGEST_SUCCESS` | Consumer | `consuming/ → success/` | Qdrant upsert complete; files archived to success |
| `→ INGEST_FAILED` | Any worker | (any) → `failed/` | Error occurred; files moved for debugging |

## Worker Roles

### Ingestion Workers

These workers communicate via Redis queues (routed through Apache NiFi) and operate on files through the pipeline stages:

| Worker | Entry Point | Queue(s) | Role |
|--------|------------|----------|------|
| **Gatekeeper** | `run_gatekeeper.py` | Claims from DuckDB | Extracts raw text via handler chain, normalizes to Markdown via Supervisor LLM, writes `.md` file. Dispatches OCR and Whisper jobs via Redis → NiFi. |
| **OCR** | `run_ocr_worker.py` | `ocr_job_input` / `ocr_job_output` (via NiFi) | Processes image-based PDF pages via Docling/EasyOCR |
| **WhisperX** | `run_whisperx_worker.py` | `whisper_job_input` / `whisper_job_output` (via NiFi) | Transcribes audio/video files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.flac`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`) |
| **Producer** | `run_producer.py` | Reads from `ingestion/` | Claims normalized Markdown, splits into chunks with `[DOC_XXXX]` IDs, enqueues to Redis via NiFi (`QUEUE_NAMES`), sends `file_end` sentinel |
| **Consumer** | `run_consumer.py` | `QUEUE_NAMES` (via NiFi, partitioned) | Buffers chunks in DuckDB, on sentinel: retrieves, embeds, upserts to Qdrant, archives to Parquet |

### API Server

The FastAPI backend serves HTTP requests on port 8000 — it does not operate on Redis queues:

| Component | Entry Point | Interface | Role |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------|
| **FastAPI** | `apimain.py` | HTTP :8000 | REST API for chat queries, status, and health checks |

The **Gatekeeper** worker uses the supervisor LLM (configured via `SUPERVISOR_LLM_ENDPOINTS`) for normalization, but only as a last resort. Before calling the LLM, extracted text runs through `is_bad_ocr()` — if quality passes, it is written directly as Markdown without LLM inference. This three-tier approach (pdfplumber → OCR → supervisor LLM) avoids paying LLM token cost for pages that are already clean. The **RAG chat** uses a separate LLM (configured via `LLM_PATH`). In many deployments these run on the same GPU host but are distinct conceptual roles — normalization during ingestion vs. inference during chat.

---

## Content Handler Chain

The Gatekeeper uses a **Chain of Responsibility** pattern to extract raw text from files. Handlers are chained in priority order:

```
PDFContentTypeHandler → MP4ContentTypeHandler → MP3ContentTypeHandler → TextContentTypeHandler
```

| Handler | Extensions | Method |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `PDFContentTypeHandler` | `.pdf` | `pdfplumber` (fast text-layer check); falls back to Docling/EasyOCR via OCR worker for scanned/gibberish pages |
| `MP4ContentTypeHandler` | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv` | Delegates to WhisperX worker via Redis for transcription |
| `MP3ContentTypeHandler` | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.flac` | Delegates to WhisperX worker via Redis for transcription |
| `TextContentTypeHandler` | `.txt`, `.md`, `.html` | Direct file read (charset-normalized for HTML) |

All handlers return a **generator stream** of raw text strings, which the Gatekeeper batches and sends to the Supervisor LLM for normalization.

---

## DuckDB State Machine

The `ingestion_lifecycle` table tracks every file through its complete journey:

```
NEW → PREPROCESSING → PREPROCESSING_COMPLETE → INGESTING → CONSUMING → INGEST_SUCCESS
                                                                       → INGEST_FAILED
```

Key properties:
- **Atomic claims**: Workers use `UPDATE ... RETURNING *` to atomically claim the next available job in a target state.
- **Retry logic**: All DuckDB operations use a **20-retry exponential backoff** to resolve lock contention across parallel workers.
- **Timestamp columns**: Each transition records a dedicated timestamp (`new_at`, `preprocessing_at`, `preprocessing_complete_at`, `ingesting_at`, `consuming_at`, `finalized_at`).

---

## Redis Queue Architecture (via NiFi Middleware)

Apache NiFi sits as transparent middleware between all workers and Redis queues. Every queue has an `_input` and `_output` suffix pair — workers write to `*_input`, NiFi's bridge processors consume from `*_input` and produce to `*_output`, and downstream workers read from `*_output`.

| Queue Pair | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `ocr_job_input` / `ocr_job_output` | Image-based pages: Gatekeeper → NiFi → OCR Worker → NiFi → Gatekeeper |
| `whisper_job_input` / `whisper_job_output` | Audio/video files: Gatekeeper/Producers → NiFi → WhisperX Worker → NiFi → requestor |
| `QUEUE_NAMES` (partitioned, e.g., `chunk_ingest_input:0` / `chunk_ingest_output:0`) | Chunk pipeline: Producer → NiFi → Consumer. One partition per consumer process, ensuring all chunks + sentinel for a file arrive at the same consumer. |

NiFi provides data governance, provenance tracking, flow orchestration, and operational control without requiring any code changes to the workers. See `nifi/README.md` for full details on flow setup, processor configuration, and monitoring.

---

## Protections Against Failures

1. **Partial Write Protection**: DuckDB acts as a Write-Ahead Log. Qdrant never sees half of a document — chunks are staged in DuckDB until the `file_end` sentinel arrives, then retrieved and upserted atomically.
2. **Deterministic IDs**: Chunks use MurmurHash3 content-addressable IDs. Re-ingesting a file cleanly overwrites existing chunks in Qdrant rather than duplicating them.
3. **IO Management**: Staging in DuckDB reduces simultaneous requests hitting Qdrant, protecting lower-powered hardware like minipcs.
4. **Crash Recovery**: If the Consumer crashes mid-upsert, the staged chunks remain in DuckDB and can be replayed on restart.

## HAProxy Load Balancing

When multiple backend endpoints are configured for any service, HAProxy automatically distributes requests across them. This is transparent to the Python workers — they see a single URL and HAProxy handles the routing.

### Supported Services

| Service | Env Var (endpoints) | HAProxy Port | Stats Port | Auto-Override |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Supervisor LLM | `SUPERVISOR_LLM_ENDPOINTS` | 11437 | 8404 | `SUPERVISOR_LLM_ENDPOINTS` → `http://haproxy_supervisor:11437/v1` |
| Embeddings | `EMBEDDING_ENDPOINTS` | 11438 | 8405 | `EMBEDDING_ENDPOINTS` → `http://haproxy_embd:11438/v1` |
| WhisperX | `WHISPER_MODEL_ENDPOINTS` | 11439 | 8406 | `WHISPER_MODEL_ENDPOINTS` → `http://haproxy_whisper:11439/inference` |
| OCR | `OCR_ENDPOINTS` | 11440 | 8407 | `OCR_ENDPOINTS` → `http://haproxy_ocr:11440/v1/convert/file` |

### Behavior by Endpoint Count

| Endpoints | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| 0 (unset) | HAProxy returns 503. The `*_ENDPOINTS` env var is used directly (no haproxy dependency). |
| 1 | Transparent proxy to that single backend. |
| 2+ | `roundrobin` balancing with `httpclose` (no keep-alive pinning). Health checks on `/models` or `/health`. |

### How It Works

1. `run-compose.sh` detects `*_ENDPOINTS` env vars and auto-sets the corresponding `*_PATH` to the haproxy container URL.
2. The HAProxy entrypoint script (`infra/haproxy-entrypoint.sh`) generates the config at container startup from the `*_ENDPOINTS` env var.
3. Workers connect to haproxy as if it were a single backend. HAProxy distributes requests across all healthy backends.
4. Stats UI available at `http://localhost:<stats-port>/stats` for each service.

### Configuration

Endpoints are comma-separated URLs. Each URL can include the full path — HAProxy extracts `host:port` for routing and forwards the original request path.

```bash
export SUPERVISOR_LLM_ENDPOINTS=http://gpu0:11435/v1/chat/completions,http://gpu1:11436/v1/chat/completions
export EMBEDDING_ENDPOINTS=http://gpu0:11434/v1/embeddings
export WHISPER_MODEL_ENDPOINTS=http://whisper0:1145/inference,http://whisper1:1145/inference
export OCR_ENDPOINTS=http://ocr0:5001/v1/convert/file,http://ocr1:5001/v1/convert/file
./doc-ingest-chat/run-compose.sh --build
```
